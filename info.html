           <p>Engineering describes building solutions to engines, machines, structures or processes. Engineers apply mathematic, scientific, technical and design knowledge and skills to develop new processes or improve existing ones within businesses and government. Engineers may work individually or within teams to create solutions that are cost-effective and safe within a specified budget. Engineering is a large employment field that offers many specializations, and roles can vary from research and development to product design. All engineering specialties are experiencing job growth with many internship and employment opportunities available.</p>
            <p>The manufacturing industry produces both durable and nondurable goods for consumption. Because manufacturing includes many complex processes, there is a broad spectrum of types of positions within the industry that are suitable for workers of varying skill levels. Within manufacturing you will find engineers, technicians, administrative and supervisory staff, production workers, quality control inspectors, sales representatives, and clerical support staff. Over the past several decades, manufacturing has grown increasingly automated, involving computers and robots. This shift in the industry has created additional opportunities for engineers, who are needed to program, install, and maintain automated machinery.</p>
            <p>Transportation is the movement of people, animals and goods from one location to another. Modes of transport include air, rail, road, water, cable, pipeline and space. The field can be divided into infrastructure, vehicles and operations. Transport is important because it enables trade between people, which is essential for the development of civilizations.</p>
